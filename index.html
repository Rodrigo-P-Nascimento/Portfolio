                    <h3>Deterministic Finite Automaton Minimize</h3>

                    <P>
                        This was a project for the Theory of Computation course, and the group consisted of me and my colleague <a class="linkC"  href="https://github.com/Durkh" target="_blank" rel="external">EgÃ­dio Neto</a>.

                        The code written in C implements a minimization algorithm for a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The code takes as input the description of the DFA and then uses minimization techniques, such as the Myhill-Nerode algorithm or the Table Filling Method, to reduce the number of states and transitions in the DFA. During the execution of the code, detailed steps of the minimization process will be displayed. The final result will be a minimized DFA, which can be used to optimize the representation and performance of the automaton.

                    </P>

                    <h3>Optimization of product production lines</h3>

                    <p>

                    This project aims to find the best production configuration (minimizing time) for a set of products and production lines, using input data from a file. Initially, we employ a greedy heuristic to generate an initial solution. Next, we apply the Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) algorithm with two neighborhood moves to refine this solution and achieve an even better result. The project was developed in collaboration with my fellow undergraduate students, <a class="linkC" href="https://github.com/Bertrand-DB" target="_blank" rel="external">Bertrand Dantas</a> and <a class="linkC" href="https://github.com/joaovictor720" target="_blank" rel="external">JoÃ£o Victor</a>, as part of the Algorithm Analysis and Design course. We are proud to share the outcome of our public work, which represents our combined effort to solve this challenging optimization problem.

                    <h3>Qt CRUD</h3>

                    <p>This project consists of implementing a CRUD with a graphical interface in C++, using the Qt library, and also integrating it with a database using SQL.The project was developed in collaboration with my fellow undergraduate students, <a class="linkC" href="https://github.com/LuizH-Queiroz" target="_blank" rel="external">Luiz Henrique</a> and <a class="linkC" href="https://github.com/taylorkcantalice" target="_blank" rel="external">Taylor Cantalice</a>, as part of the Programming Language 1 course.</p>

                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>Currently, I am studying Computer Engineering at UFPB, and I have had the opportunity to work with various programming languages and technologies, such as:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="ferramental">
                        <li>- Web development using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript;</li>
                        <li>- C and C++; </li>
                        <li>- Python; </li>
                        <li>- GUI development using Qt;</li> 
                        <li>- Android Studio;</li>
                        <li>- Godot;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I have always believed that studying and practicing different areas of software development would provide me with a broader perspective on problem-solving. Having experimented with various technologies, I am confident in my ability to work with any of them. To be honest, I don't have a favorite language or technology. If a particular language or technology solves my problem, that's the one I choose.</p>

                    <p>I am excited to think about how I will solve the next problem that is presented to me!</p>
